# Counter Script Workflow

This script increments a counter stored in `counter.txt` each time it's executed, with automation available via GitHub Actions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git`
   
2. **Run the script locally**:  
   `chmod +x counter.sh && ./counter.sh`
   
3. **GitHub Actions**:  
   The script runs automatically on `push` to the `main` branch via the configured GitHub Actions workflow.
